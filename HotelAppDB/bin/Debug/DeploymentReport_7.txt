     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[Bookings].[GuestsId] is being dropped, data loss could occur.
       The column [dbo].[Bookings].[GuestId] on table [dbo].[Bookings] must be added, but the column has no default value and
         does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must
         either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults
         as a deployment option.
       The type for column RoomNumber in table [dbo].[Rooms] is currently  NCHAR (10) NOT NULL but is being changed to  VARCHAR
         (10) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with type 
         VARCHAR (10) NOT NULL.
       The type for column Title in table [dbo].[RoomTypes] is currently  NVARCHAR (100) NOT NULL but is being changed to 
         NVARCHAR (50) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible
         with type  NVARCHAR (50) NOT NULL.
